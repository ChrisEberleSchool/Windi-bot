##  Software Overview

The ESP32 runs **custom firmware** that:
- Reads sensor data for temperature and humidity  
- Connects to Wi-Fi to retrieve outdoor weather data  
- Determines window position based on user-defined comfort thresholds  
- Controls motor movement with safe limit handling  

This firmware is written in **C++ (Arduino / ESP-IDF)** and can be updated over USB or OTA (Over-the-Air).
